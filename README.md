# Tasker

This is a todo list application developed to practice JavaScript, modular design, DOM manipulation, and using the Web Storage API. It allows users to create and manage todo items and projects to help them stay organized and productive.

It was an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) from The Odin Project curriculum.
